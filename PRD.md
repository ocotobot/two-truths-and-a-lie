# Planning Guide

A playful and educational guessing game where players identify the false statement among three AI-generated facts about various topics, challenging their knowledge while learning new information.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Playful** - The game should feel lighthearted and fun with celebratory animations and emoji reactions that make learning enjoyable
2. **Engaging** - Each round should be intriguing with compelling statements that make players think critically and want to play again

- **Slow Network**: Display loading spinner with "Generating statements..." message during API calls
- **Invalid Responses**: Validate LLM output has exactly 3 statements; regenerate if malformed
- **Rapid Clicking**: Disable statement cards after first selection to prevent multiple guesses
- **Empty Topic**: "Surprise Me" randomly selects from available topics

## Design Direction

The design should feel playful yet sophisticated with a vibrant color palette that evokes curiosity and fun. It should strike a balance between educational credibility and game-like excitement, with smooth animations that celebrate success without being overwhelming. The interface should be minimal with plenty of breathing room, allowing the content (statements) to be the hero while UI elements provide clear wayfinding.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme to create vibrant, energetic feeling while maintaining clear visual hierarchy and excellent readability

- **Primary Color**: Vibrant Purple (oklch(0.55 0.22 290)) - Represents curiosity and intelligence, used for main CTAs and headers
- **Secondary Colors**: Teal (oklch(0.65 0.15 200)) for correct answers and supporting elements; Coral (oklch(0.70 0.18 30)) for incorrect feedback and accents
- **Accent Color**: Bright Yellow-Orange (oklch(0.80 0.18 70)) for hover states, "Surprise Me" option, and celebratory moments
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Soft Cream oklch(0.98 0.01 90)): Dark Purple text (oklch(0.25 0.15 290)) - Ratio 11.2:1 âœ“
  - Primary (Vibrant Purple oklch(0.55 0.22 290)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 6.8:1 âœ“
  - Secondary (Teal oklch(0.65 0.15 200)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 âœ“
  - Accent (Yellow-Orange oklch(0.80 0.18 70)): Dark Purple text (oklch(0.25 0.15 290)) - Ratio 6.2:1 âœ“
  - Card (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark text (oklch(0.25 0.15 290)) - Ratio 13.5:1 âœ“
  - Muted (Light Purple oklch(0.95 0.05 290)): Medium Purple text (oklch(0.45 0.12 290)) - Ratio 5.1:1 âœ“

## Font Selection

Typography should feel friendly and approachable while maintaining clarity, using rounded sans-serif fonts that communicate playfulness without sacrificing legibility

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Game Title): Fredoka Bold/36px/tight letter-spacing (-0.5px) - Playful rounded sans-serif for main heading
  - H2 (Topic Names): Fredoka Medium/20px/normal letter-spacing - Consistent with title but smaller
  - Body (Statements): Inter Regular/17px/relaxed line-height (1.6) - Clean, readable for longer text
  - Small (Score, Labels): Inter Medium/14px/normal letter-spacing - Clear hierarchy from body text
  - Button Text: Inter SemiBold/16px/wide letter-spacing (0.5px) - Strong, actionable appearance

## Animations

Animations should punctuate moments of discovery and success, creating micro-celebrations when players guess correctly while providing gentle feedback for incorrect guesses, all while maintaining snappy performance

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Card flips reveal answers with playful bounce, confetti or emoji reactions burst on correct guesses, and gentle shake on wrong answers communicates feedback personality
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Statement cards have subtle hover lift (priority 1), reveal animations are prominent but quick (priority 2), score updates with gentle pulse (priority 3), and background reactions are subtle and non-blocking (priority 4)
